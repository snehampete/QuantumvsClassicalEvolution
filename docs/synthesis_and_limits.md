# Synthesis and Limits

Synthesizes experimental results and clarifies compatibility between quantum dynamics and evolutionary search.

## Why Raw Quantum Conflicts with Evolution

**Quantum**: Unitary, reversible dynamics preserve information, amplify coherent phase structure.  
**Evolution**: Irreversible, stochastic disruption destroys structure to escape deceptive basins.  

**Experiments show**: Coherence preserves/amplifies where evolution requires breaking.

## Comparison to Grover/Shor

Successful quantum algorithms exploit **rigid global structure**:

| Algorithm | Key Structure | Quantum Role |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Grover | Binary oracle, marked subspace | Amplifies target amplitude |
| Shor | Algebraic periodicity | Fourier extracts period |

**Evolutionary problems lack this**: Local ruggedness + irreversible exploration needs.

## When Quantum Helps / Doesn't

**Effective when**:
- Global phase-coherent structure exists
- Objective = stable geometric/algebraic pattern
- Interference aligns with problem geometry

**Ineffective when**:
- Irreversibility/entropy increase required
- Local disruption needed
- Naive fitness→phase mapping

## Implications

### 1. For Quantum Optimization Research
- **Falsifies naive coherence**: Superposition/interference ≠ evolutionary noise (preserves structure)
- **Clarifies quantum role**: Representation/mixing, not autonomous exploration
- **Boundary mapping**: Negative results constrain viable designs

### 2. Design Lessons
- Avoid fitness→phase encodings (worsens deception)
- Unitary dynamics ≠ irreversibility/diversity
- Hybrids: Classical = disruption; Quantum = structure amplification

### 3. Connection to Established Algorithms
**Grover/Shor succeed** via rigid structure quantum amplifies.  
**Evolution resists** coherent treatment: needs local destruction.

## Scope and Limits
Demonstrates raw quantum principles don't naturally align with evolutionary objectives. Success requires confronting this mismatch explicitly.
