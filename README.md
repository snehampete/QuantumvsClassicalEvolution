# Quantum Interference vs Evolutionary Search

*A mechanism-first investigation!*

**Core question**: Does raw quantum coherence (superposition + interference) naturally aid evolutionary escape from deceptive/rugged fitness landscapes—or does it conflict?

## Key Findings
- Classical GA baselines: basin capture (deceptive), info dilution (rugged)
- Superposition alone ≡ classical uniform sampling (no gain)
- Naive fitness→phase interference *worsens* deception
- Unitary dynamics amplify structure; evolution needs irreversible breaking

**Conclusion**: Quantum success requires classical scaffolding. [Full report → `./docs/overview.md`]

## 4. What is NOT claimed

This project intentionally avoids the usual quantum-optimization claims. In particular, it does **not** assume or invoke:

* a full quantum genetic algorithm
* algorithmic speedup or complexity advantages
* tunneling-based barrier traversal
* superiority over classical heuristics
* relevance to near-term quantum hardware

The absence of these claims is deliberate: **the goal is not to argue that a quantum algorithm works, but to test whether the physics itself supports the intuition that it should.**
